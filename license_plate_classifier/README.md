# License Plate Classifier

This is a machine learning solution that classifies license plates as either accepted or rejected based on the NYC rejected vanity plates dataset from Kaggle.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about rejected vanity plates in New York City. There are two csv files, one containing the rejected vanity plates and the other containing the accepted vanity plates. The dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/datanews/license-plates).
